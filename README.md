### ðŸ”Š Technical terms and definitions

1. ALM (application lifecycle management) - is a continuous process of managing the life of an application through governance, development and maintenance.
2. AUT (application under test) - it's an application located in the Testing phase of SDLC.
3. Build repository - a storage location from which software packages may be retrieved and installed on a computer.
4. Behavior-driven development (BDD) - is an Agile software development process that encourages collaboration among developers, QA and non-technical or business participants in a software project.
5. CI (Continuous Integration) - the practice of merging all developer working copies to shared mainline several times a day.
6. CD (Continuous Delivery) - a software engineering approach in which teams produce software in short cycles, ensuring that the software can be reliably released at any time.
7. CD (Continuous Deployment) - a practice where every change that passes all stages of your production pipeline is automatically released to your customers.
8. Code Smells - refers to any symptom in the source code of a program that possibly indicates a deeper problem.
9. CSRF (cross-site request forgery) - a type of malicious exploit of a website where unauthorized commands are transmitted from a user that the website trusts.
10. ISV (independent software vendor) - a company whose primary function is to distribute software.
11. IDE (Integrated Development Environment) - a software application that provides comprehensive facilities to computer programmers for software development.
12. Jira - a proprietary issue tracking product, developed by Atlassian. It provides bug tracking, issue tracking, and project management functions.
13. Static Code Analysis - the analysis of computer software that is performed without actually executing programs (analysis performed on executing programs is known as dynamic analysis).
14. Smoke test - a type of software testing that comprises a non-exhaustive set of tests that aim at ensuring that the most important functions work.
15. SDLC (Systems development life cycle, also referred to as the application development life cycle) - a process for planning, creating, testing, and deploying an information system.
16. Test harness - a collection of software and test data configured to test a program unit by running it under varying conditions and monitoring its behavior and outputs.
17. Technical debt - a concept in programming that reflects the extra development work that arises when code that is easy to implement in the short run is used instead of applying the best overall solution.
18. Test-driven development (TDD) - approach first, the test is developed which specifies and validates what the code will do.
19. UAT (User Acceptance Testing) - the last phase of the software testing process, during which actual software users test the software to make sure it can handle required tasks in real-world scenarios, according to specifications.
20. Version control system - a system to manage changes to documents, computer programs, large websites, and other collections of information.
21. XSS (cross-site scripting) - a type of computer security vulnerability typically found in web applications. XSS enables attackers to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.
